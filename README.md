Multiple Linear Regression Example of using 10000 line dataset
Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable

Linear Regression
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features. When the number of the independent feature, is 1 then it is known as Univariate Linear regression, and in the case of more than one feature, it is known as multivariate linear regression. The goal of the algorithm is to find the best linear equation that can predict the value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables. The equation provides a straight line that represents the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The slope of the line indicates how much the dependent variable changes for a unit change in the independent variable(s).
